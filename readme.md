# üå≤ komatsu

the parallel spinner logger with the fresh pine scent

![komatsu screencast](komatsu.gif)

## usage

`npm install komatsu`

```js
const Komatsu = require('komatsu')
const logger = new Komatsu()

// a unique label. logging again with the same label overwrites the line
logger.log('label', {
	status: 'pending', // the default. or, 'done', 'info' or 'fail'
	message: 'a nice message',
	error: new Error(`i'll print the stack trace`),
})
```

while any logger is `pending`, new loggers (with a label that hasn't been seen yet) will appear on the next line. once all current loggers are no longer `pending`, i'll clear a line. if i'm the only thing that's running timers, node will exit. otherwise, any loggers will appear after the empty line (even if their label was used before).

## the name
